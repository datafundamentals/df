# Missing Files?

If you are viewing this in VSCode there are several files that are intentionally not showing

## Which files?
   - node_modules
   - _site
   - package-lock.json
   - .vscode
   - .git
   - *.sh
   - .gitignore
        

## Why Missing

This is a teaching project. There are a lot of supporting files which distract from the lessons being taught.

## How to view, change, etc

Use the terminal and the command line.

The command `code .gitignore` will open the .gitignore file, for example.

## How does this happen?

Look in the .vscode/settings.json file. 

## Is this really necessary?

No. But get over it.
