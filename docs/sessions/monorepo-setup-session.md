# Session: Monorepo Setup - Claude Session Checklist Implementation
**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Scope:** Create bulletproof Claude session checklist and apply it to establish proper monorepo session protocols

## Pre-Session Context
- Previous work: Moving from apps/approach to monorepo structure
- Dependencies: apps/approach/CONTEXT_SESSION_CLAUDE_STRATEGY.md strategy document
- Related projects: RAG system in apps/approach needs migration to monorepo structure

## Session Objectives
1. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive docs/CLAUDE_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md
2. üîÑ Apply checklist protocols to current session
3. ‚è≥ Establish proper session handoff documentation
4. ‚è≥ Exit cleanly following protocols

## Key Discoveries
- Current structure already follows hybrid monorepo pattern with apps/, shared/, docs/
- apps/approach contains complex RAG system with ChromaDB, Ollama, Firestore integration
- Comprehensive strategy document exists with session management best practices
- Need to establish docs/architecture.md and docs/shared-resources.md

## Architectural Decisions Made
- Created standardized checklist covering pre-session, during-session, and post-session protocols
- Established templates for different session types (project-specific, shared resources, integration)
- Defined clear criteria for continue vs exit decisions
- Implemented TodoWrite-based task tracking throughout

## Session Checklist Application Status

### ‚úÖ Pre-Session Setup
- [x] Read relevant documentation (CONTEXT_SESSION_CLAUDE_STRATEGY.md)
- [x] Verified working directory and git status
- [x] Defined clear session scope (checklist creation + application)
- [x] Created TodoWrite list for tracking

### üîÑ During Session
- [x] Using TodoWrite for task tracking
- [x] Documenting decisions in real-time
- [x] Following existing patterns (docs/ structure, markdown format)
- [x] Maintaining monorepo awareness

### ‚úÖ Pre-Exit Protocols (Completed)
- [x] Update project documentation (architecture.md, shared-resources.md created)
- [x] Create next session context (apps-approach-migration-session.md created)
- [x] Document handoff requirements (comprehensive migration context provided)
- [x] Complete clean exit per protocols (session documentation finalized)

## Next Session Recommendations
1. **Session Type:** Integration Session
2. **Scope:** Migrate apps/approach RAG system to proper monorepo structure
3. **Prerequisites:** Read docs/sessions/apps-approach-migration-session.md and follow checklist
4. **Expected Outcome:** Clean monorepo structure with shared components extracted and documented

## Blockers/Dependencies
None identified for this session. Migration work will require understanding current RAG system architecture.

## Success Metrics Achieved
- ‚úÖ Bulletproof checklist created with comprehensive protocols
- ‚úÖ Current session following documented best practices
- ‚úÖ Clear handoff preparation in progress
- ‚úÖ Sustainable session management foundation established
